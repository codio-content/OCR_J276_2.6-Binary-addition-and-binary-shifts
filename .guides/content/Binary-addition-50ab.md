 Binary additions are similar to denary additions in that numbers may have to be carried over to the next column.

In denary, if the addition is greater than 10 e.g. 13, then the 1 is carried over to the next column and the 3 remains.

In binary there are only two digits, 1 and 0.
1 + 0 = 1 and so no carry over is needed.
1 + 1 = 10 (2 in denary) and so the 1 is carried over and the 0 remains.
1 + 1 + 1 = 11 (3 in denary) and so the 1 is carried over and the 1 remains.

Here is an example: 01011110 + 01100111

You can check by converting to denary.
The answer 11000101 = 197
01011110 = 94 and 01100111 = 103
94 + 103 = 197!
